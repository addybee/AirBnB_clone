AirBnB Clone (The COnsole)

DESCRIPTION:
This project is an implementation of an AirBnB clone command-line interface (CLI) using Python. It allows users to manage AirBnB objects such as users, states, cities, places, etc., through a command-line interface.

The command interpreter is a CLI tool that allows users to interact with the AirBnB clone project. Below are instructions on how to start and use it:

To start the command interpreter:
- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Next change directory to the project directory
- Then run the command interpreter script

### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is started, you can use the following commands:
- `create`: Create a new object (user, state, city, place, etc.).
- `show`: Show details of a specific object.
- `destroy`: Delete a specific object.
- `all`: Show all objects or objects of a specific class.
- `update`: Update attributes of a specific object.
- `quit` or `EOF`: Exit the command interpreter.

### Examples of how to use the interpreter
- to create a new user: `create User`
- to show details of a specific user: type `show User 123`
- to delete a specific user: type `destroy User 123`
- to show all cities: type `all City`
- when you want to update the name of a place: type `update Place 456 name "New Name"`
